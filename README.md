# Number-plate-localzation

This is a simple algorrithm to localozre the vehicles number plate suing OpenCV-python library. 

First we import the image and using the imutils library we have  resized the image. Using the cv2 metrhod we have removed the RGB and convereted ton grascale and processed the image
for noise reduction. Using the canny edge detector we have created all the existing contours of the images.
